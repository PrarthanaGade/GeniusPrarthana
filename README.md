# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights and trends. It leverages Python libraries to process, visualize, and interpret data effectively.

---

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  - Normalize and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize data patterns and relationships using charts and graphs.
  - Calculate statistical summaries.
- **Insights Generation**:
  - Identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
  - Use data-driven approaches to answer specific research questions.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `NumPy`: Numerical computations.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning (if applicable).
